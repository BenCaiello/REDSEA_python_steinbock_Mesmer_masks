This folder contains the translated version of REDSEA matlab code. The code is a direct tranlation of the code, thus should perform the same.

However, certain helper functions are not available in the python code, eg. the sanity check plots and production of fcs files. These can be added by the user if needed.

NOTE: this code is not extensively benchmarked, thus please notify us if user see anything abnormal.
